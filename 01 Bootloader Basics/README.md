## Introduction

The bootloader is a fundamental component of any Android device. It's the first piece of software that runs when a device is powered on, setting the stage for the operating system to take over. This section, "Bootloader Basics", aims to demystify the bootloader's role, its intricacies, and its significance in the Android boot sequence.
